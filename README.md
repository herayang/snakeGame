# Overview

This is my attempt on recreating of the classic snake game. Use the 4 arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to change the direction of the moving snake, and help it eat the food randomly generated on the screen! If the snake touches the walls/its own body, the game will end. The more food it eats, the longer it gets (and the higher score you gain).
